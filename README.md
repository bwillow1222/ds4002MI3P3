# Pet Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-powered tool to assist adoption centers in identifying the breeds of pets (cats and dogs) from images. Using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, we preprocess the data, train a pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet50), and evaluate its ability to classify pet breeds accurately. Our goal is to achieve at least 85% accuracy in breed identification, providing a reliable solution to improve adoption outcomes.

## Software and Platform

### Software:
- **Python 3.8 or higher**

### Required Packages
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.  
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn**: For visualizing data distribution and model performance.  
- **PyTorch**: For implementing and fine-tuning the pre-trained neural network (ResNet50).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.

### Platform:
- The project was run in the Rivanna HPC, as access to NVIDIA CUDA is necessary
